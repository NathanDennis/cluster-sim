### Cluster Sim

A project to learn about simulating http traffic to a Go server and load balancing with NGINX using a Raspberry Pi 4 cluster

#### Tech
- [Golang](https://golang.org/) for a simple http server with a few endpoints serving very basic JSON data
- [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) - HTTP benchmarking
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) - Load balancing

Currently there are 2x 2gb Raspberry Pi 4s running a headless Raspbian Lite OS
